# Basic Artificial Neural Network from Scratch

###  This repository correspononds to a artificial neural network build from scratch without any machine learning library and only using the numpy library for all the matricial calculus. It was part of a volunteer project for the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Barcelona.

Other libraries are used for ploting and timing.

The ANN was trained on the MNIST data set with an accuracy of 0.9 (validation).
